# BlueGuardian

**BlueGuardian** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to monitor and visualize river water quality in real-time using water sensors and server services. The app empowers users to interact with live environmental data, aiming to protect and improve our connected aquatic environments.

This project is part of the UCL CASA0015 Mobile Systems coursework, demonstrating comprehensive skills in mobile application development, IoT integration, cloud communication, and user-centered interaction design.

**Protecting Our Waters through IoT and Mobile Technologies**

## Development Environment

- Flutter version: 3.7.12
- Dart version: 3.3.0
- Dart version: 2.19.6 
- DevTools version:  2.20.1
- Tested on: iOS 14(iPhone 13 Pro Max), iOS 18(iPhone15 Pro Max)
- Major dependencies:
  - `flutter_map` (Map display)
  - `flutter_map_marker_popup` (Map marker interaction)
  - `fl_chart` (Line charts)
  - `mqtt_client` (MQTT protocol support)
  - `shared_preferences` (Persistent local storage)
  - `intl` (Date and Time formatting)

---

## Key Flutter Widgets Used

- `GridView`, `ListView`, `Stack`, `GestureDetector`
- `AnimatedOpacity` (animations)
- `Card`, `ElevatedButton`, `TextField`
- `FlutterMap`, `FlChart`
- `SharedPreferences`

All interfaces adapt responsively to different screen sizes for a consistent user experience across devices.

## User Journey

- Launch App âž” Splash Screen âž” Home Page with rivers list âž”
- Customize server settings if needed
- Select a river âž” Real-time Map with live sensor markers âž”
- Tap on markers to view sensor readings âž”
- Access Sensor Data History âž” Browse past week's readings âž”
- Visualize historical trends via interactive Graphs âž”


---

## Data Management and Collection

The app continuously subscribes to real-time MQTT topics to collect Dissolved Oxygen (DO), TDS, Turbidity, pH, Temperature, and Coliform data from connected river sensors.  
Users can also request historical data for specific dates. Data are visualized both in list view and dynamic charts for clear trend analysis.

---

## GitHub Development Workflow

The GitHub repository maintains a continuous and detailed commit history to reflect iterative development. Each feature addition, UI improvement, and bug fix is committed separately to demonstrate progress clearly.

âœ… Version control practices followed: branching, progressive commits, meaningful messages.

   flutter pub get
   ```
2. Run on emulator or real device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
3. Configure MQTT server:
   - Open Settings page inside the app.
   - Enter your MQTT Broker IP and Port.
4. Start browsing river sensor data!

## MQTT Topics Used

| Topic         | Purpose                              |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `AQ/send`     | Publish real-time sensor readings    |
| `AQ/request`  | Request historical sensor data       |
| `AQ/response` | Receive requested historical data    |

## Problem Statement

Many urban rivers are under-monitored despite rising pollution threats. Existing professional monitoring systems are expensive, complex, and inaccessible to local communities. 

**BlueGuardian** provides a low-cost, mobile-accessible system for real-time water quality tracking, aiming to foster community-driven environmental protection initiatives.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and profile tracking.
- Enable sensor fault detection and alert mechanisms.
- Integrate weather APIs to correlate water quality with environmental conditions.
- Support offline data caching for unstable network conditions.
