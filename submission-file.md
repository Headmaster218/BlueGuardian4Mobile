## Introduction to Application

**BlueGuardian** is a mobile application developed using Flutter to monitor and visualize the water quality of rivers in real-time. The app leverages IoT sensors to collect environmental data, including parameters like dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, temperature, and coliform. These sensor data are sourced from **[AquaSense](https://github.com/Headmaster218/Thames-pollution-detect-IoT)**, developed to monitor the Thames River's water quality. The data is communicated via MQTT to provide real-time updates, which are displayed on an interactive map for easy river monitoring.

In addition to real-time monitoring, **BlueGuardian** supports historical data retrieval and graphical visualizations, allowing users to track changes in water quality over time. The app provides a settings page to configure the MQTT server IP and port. By combining mobile development, IoT integration, and cloud communication, **BlueGuardian** offers a cost-effective, accessible solution to empower communities in protecting and improving local aquatic environments.
